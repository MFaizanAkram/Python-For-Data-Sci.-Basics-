For example, a binary variable (such as yes/no question) is a categorical variable having two categories (yes or no) and there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories.  Hair color is also a categorical variable having a number of categories (blonde, brown, brunette, red, etc.) and again, there is no agreed way to order these from highest to lowest.\n",

For example, suppose you have a variable, economic status, with three categories (low, medium and high).  In addition to being able to classify people into these three categories, you can order the categories as low, medium and high.\n",
